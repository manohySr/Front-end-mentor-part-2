## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JS for email validation

### What I learned

Using Css grid for the responsiveness ðŸŽ‰
Using regex for email validation ðŸŽ‰

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```js
// regex for email validation
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/;
button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  const emailValue = inputEmail.value;

  if (!emailRegex.test(emailValue)) {
    e.preventDefault();
    error_message.style.display = "block";
    inputEmail.className = "error-input";
  }
});
```

### Continued development

Working in responsive web dev

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This given me the inspiration for the responsive image.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_spacing.asp) - This helped me with the line-height property
